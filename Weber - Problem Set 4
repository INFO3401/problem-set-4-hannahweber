#1: (worked with Jacob, Marissa, Taylor, Jack, and whole class)
What may be problematic?
- How do you create a common language and dialogue between the data analysis from the interpretation of the data by the stakeholders?
- If you pass off the data from one person to another there may be some misinterpretation of the data analysis results. But if the same person both handles and analyzes the data they will be more knowledgeable as to what the data results say
- As seen with KDD - blind data mining may lead to findings that have no meaning and worthless data analysis
